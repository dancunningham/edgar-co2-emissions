> 2015 update with 2014 emissions of fossil fuel use and industrial processs emissions (cement production, carbonate use of limestone and dolomite, non-energy use of fuels and other combustion)


# Notes

For convenience three-letter country codes were added to the data when available,
the following have none assigned:

Int. Aviation, Int. Shipping, Serbia and Montenegro, Sudan (former), World

Date: 25/11/2015

Unit: kton (Gg) CO2 per year

> Note that these timeseries report country-specific CO2 emission totals of fossil fuel use and industrial processes (cement production, carbonate use of limestone and dolomite, non-energy use of fuels and other combustion). Excluded are: short-cycle biomass burning (such as agricultural waste burning) and large-scale biomass burning (such as forest fires).

The EDGARv4.3FT2014 emissions are calculated based on
	the energy balance statistics of IEA (2014) (http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/energy/co2-emissions-from-fuel-combustion-2014_co2_fuel-2014-en),
	BP (2013-2014) data of the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2015 (http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/energy-economics/statisticalreview-of-world-energy.html), Chinese coal comsumption data of the China Statistical Abstract, October 2015 (http://data.stats.gov.cn/english/easyquery.htm?cn=C01).
